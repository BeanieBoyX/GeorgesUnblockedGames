# Air Hockey Game

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/allanpope/pen/OVxVKj](https://codepen.io/allanpope/pen/OVxVKj).

A air hockey game built in JavaScript using no libraries. I wanted to learn how to use physics and get an idea of how it could be applied to elements. User can control left controller using the keyboard arrows. 

Originally I had the user controller controlled by your mouse rather than the keyboard arrows. I ran into issues with the collision function, the mouse move event would keep the controller and puck touching/overlapping. This would cause the function to run constantly, leaving the elements attached or would send the puck off in wrong direction.

Computer player could be improved.

If your interested in adding physics to something I posted this question on reddit and got a bunch of good resources.
